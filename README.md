# *around-react: My fifth project with TripleTen*  
This project is my first one using the React library! It consists of a Frontend React App that uses the same design and is connected to the the same Api as the original [web_project_4](https://frederickjodozi.github.io/web_project_4/) built with vanilla javascript.

## *Features*
The user can use the App to create a profile and add to a prexisting collection of location cards set on places of interests in the United States and abroad. The data is stored on TripleTen's Api and the locations rendered at load time come from the entire student cohort.  

The site's main React components are as follows:
- A **Frontend Api** used to create, read, update and delete user and location data.
- A **Card component** that renders a card for each location received from the Api.
- **Form Popups** that create and update data upon submission.

This projects marks the first time I have used a *linter* **(ESLint)** in a project. 

## *Contributions*
This project can be used as learning tool for people beginning to learn React. It can be cloned on a local machine for studying and/or editing, and relevant pull requests will be accepted! Required work on the project currently include adding the built-in Javascript date object to update the date listed in the footer component.  

Since this project is connected to TripleTen's Backend, the api key required to manipulate data has been removed from the project to prevent non-students from adding or deleting data. 

**Thanks again to TripleTen for providing me with the materials and instructions to build this project!**
